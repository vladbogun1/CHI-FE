# CHI-FE Project

Welcome to the CHI-FE Project! This repository houses a comprehensive suite of educational materials designed to enhance my learning experience through interactive lectures. Each lesson is structured to facilitate easy access and hands-on practice with a local web server.

## Live Access
You can directly access the project at: [CHI-FE Live](https://vladbogun1.github.io/CHI-FE/)

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x

## Installation
Clone the repository and navigate to the directory:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/vladbogun1/CHI-FE
cd CHI-FE
```

(Optional) Set up a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate    # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

Install the necessary dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r python-runner/requirements.txt
```

## Running the Server
Just execute `start.py`:
```bash
python python-runner/start.py
```
This command launches a local web server on port 8000 and opens your default web browser to `http://localhost:8000`, where you can explore the lessons.

## Lessons Overview
- `lesson-1/` to `lesson-3/`: Pure HTML/CSS/JS examples for each lesson.
- `lesson-4/` to `lesson-5/`: Stand-alone projects using React and other frameworks.

## Troubleshooting
- Ensure Python 3.x is installed.
- Check for port 8000 availability.
- If issues persist, refer to terminal errors or contact support.
